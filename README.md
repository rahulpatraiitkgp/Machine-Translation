# Machine-Translation
RNN Project [Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree]

Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. Youâ€™ll be able to explore several recurrent neural network architectures and compare their performance.
